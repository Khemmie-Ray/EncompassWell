## Problem It Solves
Mental wellness often lacks accessible, creative outlets for self-expression and healing. Traditional therapy can be expensive and intimidating, while digital platforms rarely offer a personalized and engaging experience focused on mental health. Itura bridges this gap by offering a decentralized platform that empowers users to explore their emotions and creativity through art therapy, all while benefiting from the ownership and monetization capabilities provided by blockchain technology.
